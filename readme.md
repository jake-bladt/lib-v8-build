## Build artifacts

Lib-v8 and its accompanying build problems were a big part of my realization that doing rails development directly on a Windows machine (without using a VM) was a bit of a fool's errand.

I had high hopes when I created this repository that I'd fix the build problems and get the v8 gem to build on Windows. If I do, it will require a lot more C/make juju than I currently possess.
